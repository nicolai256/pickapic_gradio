# pickapic_gradio
a local gradio UI for pickapic

# TODO
- support image metadata from more UI's (prompt and parameters)

- something to send the results to pickapic database

- something to do pickapic on images from the pickapic database

- settings for default folders etc..

- installation guide

- integration into various existing UI's to use it as a plugin

- login page (huggingface, google or discord)

- default images that appear randomly to verify user is not abusing the tool and influencing the database badly

- pickapic estimation on the images to verify the ratings are kind of accurate
